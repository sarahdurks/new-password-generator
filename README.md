### Built With :toolbox: 
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

# Description 
Berkeley Coding Bootcamp's JS Challenge: "Create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write."

The following was completed:

- [x] Connected HTML, CSS, and JS files 
- [x] Comments added throughout to describe file structure
- [x] Created user prompt sequence to define password criteria and reject inadmissable options, such as a password that is too short or too simple
- [x] Built function to generate random password within criteria defined by user to include lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters

## User Story :book:

> AS AN employee with access to sensitive data   
> I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria   
> SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security   

## Acceptance Criteria :white_check_mark:

> GIVEN I need a new, secure password   
> WHEN I click the button to generate a password   
> THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria   
> WHEN prompted for password criteria   
> THEN I select which criteria to include in the password   
> WHEN prompted for the length of the password   
> THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters   
> WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password   
> THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters   
> WHEN I answer each prompt   
> THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected   
> WHEN all prompts are answered   
> THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria   
> WHEN the password is generated   
> THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
